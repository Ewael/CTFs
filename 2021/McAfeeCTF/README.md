# McAfeeCTF

**McAfeeCTF** was organized by McAfee Advanced Threat Research team. *Sat, 5 Feb. 2021, 12:01 PST â€” Sun, 18 Feb. 2021, 11:59 PST*

I paticipated this CTF with the LSE team. We solved every challenges but 2. I did an easy shellcode-related one and spent hours on the OTP crypto one without success. It was an accessible and interesting [event](https://twitter.com/McAfee/status/1359540902604242947).
