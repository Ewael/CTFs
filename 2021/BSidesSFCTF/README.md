# BSidesSFCTF

**BSidesSFCTF** was organized by the BSidesSF team. *Sat, 06 March 2021, 20:00 UTC â€” Mon, 08 March 2021, 22:00 UTC*

I did this event with the LSE team and we ranked at the 12th place. We could have been better with a little more investment but still very happy with the challenges we've solved. This CTF is seriously awesome, as always. Very good infrastructure, challenges are extremly well-made. Props to the orga!
