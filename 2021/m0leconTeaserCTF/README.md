# m0lecon 2021 Teaser CTF

This CTF was organized by the **pwnthem0le** team. *fri, 14 may 2021, 17:00 UTC â€” sat, 15 may 2021, 17:00 UTC*

I participated with the LSE team and I spent most of my time on the rev chall. I could not solve the misc algo chall because of the permutations computation time.
