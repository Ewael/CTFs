# ångstromCTF

**ångstromCTF** was organized by the ångstromCTF team. *sat, 03 apr. 2021, 02:00 CEST AM — tue, 08 apr. 2021, 01:59 AM CEST*

That was a really great CTF with a large range of difficulty. The team (LSE) managed to solve a few even if we participated during 2 days instead of 5, so we we are pretty happy with the ranking overall.
