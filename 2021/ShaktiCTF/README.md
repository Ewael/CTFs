# ShaktiCTF

**ShaktiCTF** was organized by the ShaktiCTF team. *sat, 03 apr. 2021, 08:30 AM CEST â€” sun, 04 apr. 2021, 8:30 PM CEST*

This was a really accessible CTF with qualitative challenges. We managed to finish at the 2nd place with the LSE team, and I spent a really nice event overall focusing on reverse / pwn challs.
