# CTFs

This repo contains every files I made during my CTFs. Here is a list of every CTFs I participated to. You can find a `README.md` in each **repo** with informations about writeups and the CTF. For each **challenge**:

- `README.md` is my personnal writeup of the challenge. It can be detailed or not depending on the things I've learned during the challenge and how much I appreciated it. Some may not even have a writeup if it was something I already knew about or if it was not interesting for me.

- `notes` are the notes I use during my resolution. Those are just personnal notes I write while I'm working on the challenge to keep traces of what I'm doing.

- Other files, scripts, images for the writeup, downloaded resources...
